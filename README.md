1. GitHub does not allow uploading or commiting a file larger than 25 MB. Unfortunately, our traffic collision data file is larger than that, so we chose to upload a zipped version of it in the /readData folder. Please unzip it when running our code :D
2. There will be a few run-time warning when executing our code. We found that it was due to some form of syntax ambiguity that the compiler identified and could handle without error or misinterpretation. 
3. For our research on hierarchical clustering, we referred to https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_hierarchial_clustering.asp. 
4. We wrote our own code for data preprocessing and K-means clustering, and we referred to our class repository for code on random forest classification.
